# Terra Transaction Bot
A telegram bot to help you track your transactions on the terra blockchain.

## Disclaimer
This bot is still in is early stages, because of that it could happen that you may find bugs, problems, or it's also possible that it wouldn't work as intended.
Anyway I will try every time to do my best to bring the best experience to the terra blockchain end users.
I recomend you if you want to use this bot to join the [telegram group](https://t.me/terratxbotgroup) to give feedbacks and suggestions.

## How to use it
If you want to use it you can search for it on telegram @terratxbot.
If you prefer to host it by yourself you just need to create a file named config.py where you should insert the token of your bot with the sintax provided here:
```
token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
```
In advance you should comment some parts that are marked for you (as you probably won't use the feature to make announcements).


TODO:
- [x] Create an announcement feature to send messages to users
- [x] Change the current api's whit the python sdk to provide a more fast way to query the blockchain and to avoid server issues
- [ ] Give more informations about the transaction inside the messages
- [ ] Give to the users the possibility to monitor more than one address
